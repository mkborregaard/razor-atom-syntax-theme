# Tomorrow Night Bright Syntax Theme

Atom theme based on the awesome tomorrow night bright dark colors.

This theme is based on the tomorrow night bright theme of rockymadden, but I have merged that with the code from the razor atom syntax theme because the atom (ink) console was not correctly colored.


## Installation

Run the following command:

```sh
cd tomorrow-night-bright-razor-atom-syntax-theme
apm install
apm link .
```

OR `View > Preferences > Install` and search for `tomorrow-night-bright-razor-atom-syntax-theme` and install.

## Select Theme

Go to `View > Preferences > Themes` in `Syntax Themes` dropdown, select `Tomorrow Night Bright Razor Atom` from list.
